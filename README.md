# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2023
Background:

The NFL Big Data Bowl is an annual competition that challenges data scientists to analyze NFL game data and build predictive models. The goal of the competition is to develop models that can be used to predict the outcome of future games.

About the dataset:

The dataset consists of next gen stats provided by the NFL Team, available freely to the public for their use. 

It contains data from all the 8 weeks played in the 2021 NFL Season. The data includes information on each play in each game, such as the down, distance, yard line, play type, etc.

Process:

The first step involves importing the data into the Python notebook, and importing all the necessary libraries that will be useful for analysis. The libraries used for this project are : pandas, numpy, plotly, tqdm, matplotlib, tablib

The next step involves deriving a brief statistics, and removing further anomalies, if any.

After these two steps, the analysis of the data is kickstarted.

Analysis:

The analysis of the complete dataset ranges from general heads up over player's data to comparing the players, their playstyle, field positions, speed, in short overall aspects of the sport in a convenient way.

First Part of the analysis includes giving a general information about the season, which has analysis of which teams play against each other more than others, which dates had most number of games played, and which teams had a greater home advantage above others.

Second Part of the analysis has a insight over players information. Player's height, weight, their colleges, oldest players across the league and distribution of players across various positions.

Final Part of the analysis concludes the project by giving information about plays, game type, game style, field distance covered, touchdowns, pass types, speed, blocks, sacks, etc,

Challenges:

One of the major challenges was being completely new to the sport. Research about NFL was tedious and lengthy which was very challenging.
